# DUKEY'S WEBSITE

Please click here for the live project

This website is aimed at home brewing enthusiasts.  The owner of the website wishes to share his recepies pictures and home brewing ideas and have a space for other home brewing enthusiasts to be able to make contact and subscribe .


# User Experience (UX)

before starting the website I sat down with the owner and discussed what he wanted to see from his website.

Site owners goals
- It needed to be easy to navigate
- It needed a contact or chatroom style section so that he could meet other beer enthusiasts.
- He wanted a section to show the recepies he is most proud of so far.
- He would like a blogging section so that in the future he could add to it when he next brews.

we rated these goals on a scale of 1 to 5 in importance and feesability

- Easy to navigate            5--5
- chatroom/contact page       5--3 (depending on the chatroom aspect and my ability to achieve this)
- recepies                    5--5
- blogging                    3--1
- pictures                    3--5


After looking at the feesability of the goals we decided to go ahead with making the website but to leave out the blogging page for the initial update.  My skills as a developer are not quite at that stage yet and the owner does not want to do that right away anyway.  

With this in mind we decided to go for a front page with a link to his recepies and a contact page.


### Colour Scheme

    
    
I felt the site needed a clean feel to it. I have decided to go for a simple colour scheme of  #202020 and #fff8dc to facilitate this.

### Typography

I have used the fonts
